REACT Basics

REACT JS - 

    React.js is a JavaScript library that can be used to build user interfaces. With React, users can create reusable components, and these components display data as it changes over time. React Native also exists to help you create native mobile apps using React (the more common approach for users).
    
    In other words, React is a JavaScript tool that makes it easy to reason about, construct, and maintain stateless and stateful user interfaces. It provides the means to declaratively define and divide a UI into UI components (a.k.a., React components) using HTML-like nodes called React nodes. React nodes eventually get transformed into a format for UI rendering (e.g., HTML/DOM, canvas, svg, etc.).
